Data (raw data from x-ray machine in the Hydrodynamic-lab and processed videos- converted to mp4 or ogg) is published on <https:osf.io/7whdb>

In html, videos in avi format can't be used. This is the format obtained from the x-ray machine image processing. The avi videos were converted using ffmpeg and the duration was reduced to effective slide motion.

Please send issues and pull requests.
